# Spacetime Nuggets
A social app that encourages actors/users to explore and share their experience of locations and areas around them. The current paradigm of online-only social media applications prioritize time spent on app. We are trying to explore how a social app might encourage the audience to spend less time on the app and more time in physical reality. We think that the value of social interactions in physical reality lies in the re-contextualization of cyberspace in a way that is more compatible with our evolutionary roots in reality. 

While there are many potential multimedia components of the app we will focus on basic location based geofencing and text based interaction between users. We also hope to add the ability for actors to share  images and audio clips of their experience in the space. We would also like to encourage experts to share their knowledge about particular places in ways that other users can learn from and ask questions about. For example a biologist might point out a keystone species in chautauqua park that visitors might otherwise not have noticed.  We also aim to develop a platform where users can go for suggestions and ideas to create unique experiences in their current environment.

Our aim is to create a simple, accessible platform for users to interact in a unique way that cultivates a great experience.  We are hoping that we can educate and inspire our audience to look at their surroundings in new and interesting ways.
